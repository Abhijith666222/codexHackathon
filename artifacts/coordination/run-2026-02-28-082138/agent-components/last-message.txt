I’m blocked from writing files in this workspace (all write attempts are rejected by the environment), so I can’t create/update `tasks-ui/components` yet.

I located the existing Cloud Tasks UI to refactor in:

- `codex-rs/cloud-tasks/src/ui.rs`
- `codex-rs/cloud-tasks/src/app.rs`
- `codex-rs/cloud-tasks/src/new_task.rs`

Planned component split (ready to apply once write access is available):

- `tasks-ui/components/task_item.rs`
  - Reusable task row renderer for status/title/meta/summary lines.
- `tasks-ui/components/task_list.rs`
  - Reusable list renderer + empty/loading states + percent scroller title metadata.
- `tasks-ui/components/new_task_form.rs`
  - Reusable add-task composer header, body, cursor placement, env/attempts chips.
- `tasks-ui/components/loading.rs`
  - Reusable spinner + loading/empty states for list, details, env modal flows.

I can implement this exactly in the scoped directory and wire `ui.rs` to use those components once file writes are allowed.
