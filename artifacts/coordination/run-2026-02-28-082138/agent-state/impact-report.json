Write operations are blocked in this session (read-only policy): write commands are rejected and `apply_patch` is not allowed.\n\nSo I was unable to create/update any file in `tasks-ui/data` as requested.\n\nIf you want me to proceed, I need one of:\n1. The correct existing scope path (e.g., if this should map to an existing crate/module like `codex-rs/cloud-tasks` or `codex-rs/core/src/tasks`), or\n2. Write-enabled access for this workspace so I can add `tasks-ui/data` and implement the model/state/API wiring directly.",
