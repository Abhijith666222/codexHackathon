  "lastMessage": "- **Scope assumption**: this is for a `codex app-server v2` client UI (IDE/desktop/web) that manages threads, turns, streaming events, and approvals.\n\n- **Target users**\n- `Primary`: individual software engineers who need fast, keyboard-driven coding help in active repos.\n- `Secondary`: enterprise/team developers who need clear approval gates, auditability, and predictable safety behavior.\n- `Secondary`: integration developers embedding Codex into their own client and needing debuggable protocol/state visibility.\n\n- **Core user flows (must support end-to-end)**\n- Authenticate and initialize connection, with clear state if auth is missing/expired.\n- Start, resume, and fork threads from history.\n- Start a turn, view streamed progress (`item/*`, deltas), steer mid-turn, and interrupt safely.\n- Handle approval requests for commands/file changes inline, with accept/decline outcomes reflected in the timeline.\n- Review final outputs: agent message, command results, file diffs, failures, and usage/rate-limit status.\n- Recover from failures (`Not initialized`, overload/retry, network drop) without losing user input.\n- Discover and invoke skills/apps/mentions from the composer.\n\n- **Content priority order**\n- Live turn status and timeline events.\n- Pending approvals requiring user action.\n- Final answer plus actionable artifacts (diffs, commands, logs).\n- Error context with next-step guidance.\n- Thread metadata and navigation (title, updated time, status, archived state).\n\n- **Design and accessibility constraints**\n- Keyboard-first interaction for all primary actions (compose, approve, interrupt, navigate threads).\n- Screen reader support for streaming updates and approval prompts (ARIA live regions + meaningful labels).\n- WCAG 2.2 AA contrast; never use color alone for status/severity.\n- Deterministic focus management for dialogs/modals, especially approval flows.\n- Motion and streaming updates must not cause focus jumps or layout thrash.\n- Clear destructive/sensitive action confirmations with explicit scope (\u201cthis turn\u201d vs \u201csession\u201d).\n- Timestamps and status text should be human-readable and locale-safe.\n- Responsive layout must preserve full functionality on narrower panes/windows.\n\n- **Definition-of-done checklist**\n- [ ] All core flows above are testable without hidden/manual recovery steps.\n- [ ] A blocked approval always shows exactly what is blocked and what decision options are available.\n- [ ] Any error state presents a retry/recover path.\n- [ ] UI remains usable with keyboard-only and screen reader-only navigation.\n- [ ] Streaming and approval events are understandable without relying on animation or color cues.",
