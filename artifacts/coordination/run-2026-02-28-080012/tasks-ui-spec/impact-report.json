  "lastMessage": "I can\u2019t write files in this session (`read-only` sandbox + write tool blocked), so I\u2019m giving you the exact scoped scaffold content to add under `frontend/`.\n\n`frontend/tasks-ui-scaffold-spec.md`:\n```md\n# Tasks UI scaffold (MVP)\n\n## Scope (in-scope features)\n\n- List tasks\n- Create a task\n- Edit a task\n- Complete / uncomplete a task\n\nOut of scope for this scaffold:\n- Filtering, sorting, search, tags, attachments, recurring tasks, comments, sharing, bulk actions, analytics, notifications, permissions.\n\n## Screen map\n\n- `Tasks List` (default/home)\n  - Shows all tasks with title + status + quick-complete control.\n  - CTA for creating a new task.\n- `Task Form` (Create/Edit)\n  - One shared screen reused in two modes:\n    - Create mode (`POST` a new task)\n    - Edit mode (`PATCH` selected task)\n  - Fields:\n    - Title (required)\n    - Description/notes (optional)\n    - Due date (optional)\n  - Actions: Save, Cancel\n\nOptional visual state:\n- Empty state for no tasks\n- Completed section/group at bottom (or compact row style)\n\n## Interaction flows\n\n### 1) Create task\n1. User opens `Tasks List`.\n2. User selects `Add Task`.\n3. Navigate to `Task Form` in create mode.\n4. User enters title (required) and optional fields.\n5. User taps `Save`.\n6. Validate:\n   - Missing/blank title \u2192 show inline validation error, keep user on form.\n7. On success:\n   - Persist with status `pending`.\n   - Return to `Tasks List`.\n   - New task appears immediately (optimistically if API async pending).\n\n### 2) Edit task\n1. User taps `Edit` on a task in `Tasks List`.\n2. Navigate to `Task Form` in edit mode with values prefilled.\n3. User updates fields.\n4. User taps `Save`.\n5. Validate as in create flow.\n6. On success:\n   - Persist changes.\n   - Return to `Tasks List`.\n   - Task row reflects updated values.\n\n### 3) Complete / uncomplete task\n1. User toggles completion control on a task row in `Tasks List`.\n2. App immediately updates status:\n   - `pending` \u2192 `completed`\n   - `completed` \u2192 `pending`\n3. UI updates visual treatment:\n   - Completed tasks visually distinct.\n   - Optional: move completed tasks to separate bottom section.\n\n### 4) Cancel / abort editing\n1. User taps `Cancel` from `Task Form`.\n2. Unsaved edits are discarded.\n3. Return to `Tasks List` without mutation.\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n- AC-01: `Tasks List` loads and displays each task title and current status.\n- AC-02: User can create at least one task from list screen.\n- AC-03: Title is required for create/edit; blank title is blocked with clear message.\n- AC-04: Newly created tasks are persisted and visible in list within same session.\n- AC-05: Editing preloads existing data and saves updates successfully.\n- AC-06: Completion toggle works in list view without requiring a separate screen.\n- AC-07: Completed tasks are visually distinguishable from pending tasks.\n- AC-08: API/validation failures produce actionable inline error messaging and keep flow recoverable.\n- AC-09: No extra UI or feature surface beyond list/create/edit/complete is required for this scaffold baseline.\n```\n\nIf you want, I can next convert this into an implementation-ready ticket format (user stories + component checklist + route/component mapping).",
