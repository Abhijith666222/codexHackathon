I can’t write files in this session (`read-only` sandbox + write tool blocked), so I’m giving you the exact scoped scaffold content to add under `frontend/`.

`frontend/tasks-ui-scaffold-spec.md`:
```md
# Tasks UI scaffold (MVP)

## Scope (in-scope features)

- List tasks
- Create a task
- Edit a task
- Complete / uncomplete a task

Out of scope for this scaffold:
- Filtering, sorting, search, tags, attachments, recurring tasks, comments, sharing, bulk actions, analytics, notifications, permissions.

## Screen map

- `Tasks List` (default/home)
  - Shows all tasks with title + status + quick-complete control.
  - CTA for creating a new task.
- `Task Form` (Create/Edit)
  - One shared screen reused in two modes:
    - Create mode (`POST` a new task)
    - Edit mode (`PATCH` selected task)
  - Fields:
    - Title (required)
    - Description/notes (optional)
    - Due date (optional)
  - Actions: Save, Cancel

Optional visual state:
- Empty state for no tasks
- Completed section/group at bottom (or compact row style)

## Interaction flows

### 1) Create task
1. User opens `Tasks List`.
2. User selects `Add Task`.
3. Navigate to `Task Form` in create mode.
4. User enters title (required) and optional fields.
5. User taps `Save`.
6. Validate:
   - Missing/blank title → show inline validation error, keep user on form.
7. On success:
   - Persist with status `pending`.
   - Return to `Tasks List`.
   - New task appears immediately (optimistically if API async pending).

### 2) Edit task
1. User taps `Edit` on a task in `Tasks List`.
2. Navigate to `Task Form` in edit mode with values prefilled.
3. User updates fields.
4. User taps `Save`.
5. Validate as in create flow.
6. On success:
   - Persist changes.
   - Return to `Tasks List`.
   - Task row reflects updated values.

### 3) Complete / uncomplete task
1. User toggles completion control on a task row in `Tasks List`.
2. App immediately updates status:
   - `pending` → `completed`
   - `completed` → `pending`
3. UI updates visual treatment:
   - Completed tasks visually distinct.
   - Optional: move completed tasks to separate bottom section.

### 4) Cancel / abort editing
1. User taps `Cancel` from `Task Form`.
2. Unsaved edits are discarded.
3. Return to `Tasks List` without mutation.

## Acceptance criteria

- AC-01: `Tasks List` loads and displays each task title and current status.
- AC-02: User can create at least one task from list screen.
- AC-03: Title is required for create/edit; blank title is blocked with clear message.
- AC-04: Newly created tasks are persisted and visible in list within same session.
- AC-05: Editing preloads existing data and saves updates successfully.
- AC-06: Completion toggle works in list view without requiring a separate screen.
- AC-07: Completed tasks are visually distinguishable from pending tasks.
- AC-08: API/validation failures produce actionable inline error messaging and keep flow recoverable.
- AC-09: No extra UI or feature surface beyond list/create/edit/complete is required for this scaffold baseline.

If you want, I can next convert this into an implementation-ready ticket format (user stories + component checklist + route/component mapping).
