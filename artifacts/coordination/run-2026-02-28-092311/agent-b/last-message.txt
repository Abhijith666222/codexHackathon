Implemented inside scope `tasks-frontend/pages` only.

Changes made:
- Added `tasks-frontend/pages/index.html`

What it includes:
- One-page page-level layout with header + two-column shell (control panel + task board)
- Task form controls for “Create task” placeholders (title, priority, assignee, notes, buttons, helper text)
- “View” placeholders (search/filter area placeholder and view mode buttons placeholders)
- Static task sections with three columns: `Backlog`, `In progress`, `Done`, each populated with static cards
- Responsive behavior for smaller screens
