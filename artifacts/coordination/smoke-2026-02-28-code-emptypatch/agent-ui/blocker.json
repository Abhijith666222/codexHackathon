Write operations are disallowed here:\n   - `New-Item ... todo-app\\todo-ui` was rejected (`blocked by policy`).\n   - `apply_patch` was rejected (`writing outside of the project; rejected by user approval settings`).\n   - `Set-Content ...` was rejected (`blocked by policy`).\n\nIf you provide a workspace where `todo-app/todo-ui` exists and writes are enabled, I can implement the full UI scaffold (render + add/toggle/delete wiring + styling + empty state) in one pass."
