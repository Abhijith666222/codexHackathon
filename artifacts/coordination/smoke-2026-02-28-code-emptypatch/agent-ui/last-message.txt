Blocked by platform constraints; I couldn’t make the requested code changes.

What I verified:
1. `todo-app/todo-ui` does not exist in this workspace (or sibling worktrees).
2. Write operations are disallowed here:
   - `New-Item ... todo-app\todo-ui` was rejected (`blocked by policy`).
   - `apply_patch` was rejected (`writing outside of the project; rejected by user approval settings`).
   - `Set-Content ...` was rejected (`blocked by policy`).

If you provide a workspace where `todo-app/todo-ui` exists and writes are enabled, I can implement the full UI scaffold (render + add/toggle/delete wiring + styling + empty state) in one pass.
