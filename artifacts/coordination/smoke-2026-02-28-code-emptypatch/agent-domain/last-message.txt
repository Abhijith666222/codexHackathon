Blocked by workspace constraints, so I could not implement the changes yet.

What I verified:
1. `todo-app/todo-domain` does not exist in this checkout (no `todo*` files/dirs found).
2. Write operations are disabled by policy in this session:
   - `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "todo-app\\todo-domain" -Force` → `rejected: blocked by policy`
   - `apply_patch` to add `todo-app/todo-domain/.write-test` → `patch rejected ... approval settings`

Current repo state is unchanged (`git status --short` is empty).

If you provide a writable workspace (or the correct checkout containing `todo-app/todo-domain`), I can implement the todo model and actions immediately.
