Write operations are disabled by policy in this session:\n   - `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path \"todo-app\\\\todo-domain\" -Force` \u2192 `rejected: blocked by policy`\n   - `apply_patch` to add `todo-app/todo-domain/.write-test` \u2192 `patch rejected ... approval settings`\n\nCurrent repo state is unchanged (`git status --short` is empty).\n\nIf you provide a writable workspace (or the correct checkout containing `todo-app/todo-domain`), I can implement the todo model and actions immediately."
