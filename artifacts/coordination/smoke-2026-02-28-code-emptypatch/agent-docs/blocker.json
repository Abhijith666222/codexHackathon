Provide a writable workspace (or relax approval settings for file writes).\n2. Ensure `todo-app/project-docs` exists in this worktree, or confirm the correct scope path.\n3. I\u2019ll then immediately add a concise setup/usage doc with run commands, current scaffold capabilities, and clearly marked next-step enhancements."
