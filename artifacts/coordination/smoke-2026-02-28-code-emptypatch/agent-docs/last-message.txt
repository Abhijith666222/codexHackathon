Blocked by platform constraints; I could not make the required documentation change.

What I verified:
- `todo-app/project-docs` does not exist in this checkout.
- Write attempts are denied:
  - Shell create attempt (`New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "todo-app/project-docs"`) was rejected by policy.
  - `apply_patch` add-file attempt for `todo-app/project-docs/README.md` was rejected: `writing outside of the project; rejected by user approval settings`.

Because of this, I could not create/update any file in your requested scope.

Next steps to unblock:
1. Provide a writable workspace (or relax approval settings for file writes).
2. Ensure `todo-app/project-docs` exists in this worktree, or confirm the correct scope path.
3. I’ll then immediately add a concise setup/usage doc with run commands, current scaffold capabilities, and clearly marked next-step enhancements.
