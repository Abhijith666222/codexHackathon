Blocked by platform permissions, so I could not apply the scaffold changes.

What I verified:
- `todo-app` does not currently exist under the repo root.
- Creating `todo-app/app-shell` via shell command was rejected (`blocked by policy`).
- Creating files via patch was also rejected (`rejected by user approval settings`).

I’m ready to implement the full scaffold immediately, but I need a writable workspace (or adjusted approval settings) first. Once write access is enabled, I’ll create `todo-app/app-shell` with:
- base folder layout
- `package.json` scripts for build/run
- main entrypoint
- placeholder config files for a minimal runnable app
