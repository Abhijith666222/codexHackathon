I could not implement the components because this session is blocked from writing files.

What I verified:
1. `frontend/tasks-ui/components` does not exist in this worktree.
2. Creating it (`New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force frontend\tasks-ui\components`) is rejected by policy.
3. Writing via patch tool is also rejected (`rejected by user approval settings`).

No repository files were changed.

If you want, I can immediately provide an exact patch for:
- `frontend/tasks-ui/components/AddTaskForm.tsx`
- `frontend/tasks-ui/components/TaskItem.tsx`
- `frontend/tasks-ui/components/TaskList.tsx`
- `frontend/tasks-ui/components/TasksApp.tsx`

but I need a writable run (or an existing writable target path) to apply it.
