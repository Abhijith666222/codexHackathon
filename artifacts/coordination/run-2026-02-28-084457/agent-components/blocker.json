Creating it (`New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force frontend\\tasks-ui\\components`) is rejected by policy.\n3. Writing via patch tool is also rejected (`rejected by user approval settings`).\n\nNo repository files were changed.\n\nIf you want, I can immediately provide an exact patch for:\n- `frontend/tasks-ui/components/AddTaskForm.tsx`\n- `frontend/tasks-ui/components/TaskItem.tsx`\n- `frontend/tasks-ui/components/TaskList.tsx`\n- `frontend/tasks-ui/components/TasksApp.tsx`\n\nbut I need a writable run (or an existing writable target path) to apply it."
