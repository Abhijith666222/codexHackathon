Blocked by the current environment settings, so no code changes were possible.

What I verified:
- `frontend/tasks-ui/shell` does not exist in this worktree.
- Write attempts were rejected by policy:
  - `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path frontend/tasks-ui/shell -Force` → blocked by policy
  - `apply_patch` adding `frontend/tasks-ui/shell/.keep` → rejected by approval/settings

To proceed, I need a writable session (or pre-created writable scope at `frontend/tasks-ui/shell`). Once that is available, I can scaffold the structure, app entry point, and Tasks page route/container in that scope only.
