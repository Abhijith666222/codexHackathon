Blocked by platform constraints; no code changes were possible.

What I found:
- `frontend/tasks-ui/polish` does not exist in this checkout.
- Write operations are policy-blocked in this environment:
  - `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path frontend/tasks-ui/polish -Force` → rejected
  - `Set-Content -Path frontend/tasks-ui/polish/test.txt ...` → rejected
  - `apply_patch` (add/update files) → `writing outside of the project; rejected by user approval settings`

I did not modify any files outside scope (or anywhere).  
If you can provide a checkout containing `frontend/tasks-ui/polish` with write access, I can implement the responsive styling, empty-state messaging, and create/toggle interaction tests immediately.
