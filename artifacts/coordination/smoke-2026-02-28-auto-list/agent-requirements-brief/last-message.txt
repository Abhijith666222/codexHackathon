**UI Scaffold Requirements Brief**

- **Product goals (define first)**
- State the primary user outcome in one sentence: “Users can ___ in under ___ minutes.”
- Pick 1 primary success metric (activation, task completion, conversion, retention, etc.).
- Pick 2 guardrail metrics (error rate, drop-off, support tickets, performance).
- Define MVP scope: must-have vs explicitly out-of-scope for v1.

- **Target users (prioritize)**
- Identify 1 primary persona (role, skill level, motivation, pain point).
- Identify 1 secondary persona only if it changes navigation or permissions.
- Capture usage context: device, session length, frequency, environment.
- List accessibility needs relevant to your audience (keyboard-only, contrast, screen reader).

- **Core screens your scaffold should cover**
- Entry: landing/welcome + sign-in/sign-up.
- First-run: onboarding/setup (or skip path).
- Main workspace/dashboard (primary value view).
- Core flow screens: list/index, detail view, create/edit form.
- Supporting: search/filter/sort state.
- Account/settings/profile.
- System states: loading, empty, error, success/confirmation, offline/no-permission.
- Help/feedback/contact or issue-report entry point.

- **Constraints to lock before UI build**
- Platform targets: web/mobile/responsive breakpoints.
- Design system constraints: typography, color tokens, spacing scale, components.
- Technical constraints: framework, routing model, auth provider, API shape.
- Non-functionals: performance budgets, accessibility target (WCAG level), localization need.
- Compliance/security constraints: data sensitivity, logging, retention, legal copy.

- **Definition of done for scaffold**
- Every core user task maps to a screen and route.
- All critical states (loading/empty/error/success) are represented.
- Navigation and information architecture are testable end-to-end.
- Reusable layout/components are identified for future feature work.
