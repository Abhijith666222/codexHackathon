**Recommended default (most teams)**
- Framework: `Next.js` (App Router) + `TypeScript` with `strict` enabled.
- Styling: `Tailwind CSS` + CSS variables for design tokens (color, spacing, radius, typography).
- Component library: `shadcn/ui` (Radix-based primitives you own in-repo).
- Routing: built-in Next routing (file-based).
- State: `TanStack Query` for server state, `Zustand` for shared client UI state, local `useState` by default.
- Forms/validation: `React Hook Form` + `Zod`.

**If SSR/SEO is not needed (SPA)**
- Framework: `Vite` + `React` + `TypeScript`.
- Routing: `React Router`.
- Keep the same styling/components/state choices above.

**Project conventions to decide before scaffolding**
- Package manager: `pnpm`.
- Lint/format: `ESLint` + `Prettier` (or `Biome`, but only one formatter).
- Tests: `Vitest` + Testing Library; `Playwright` for e2e.
- API contracts: shared `zod` schemas for request/response validation.
- Structure: feature-first (`src/features/*`), shared UI in `src/components/ui`.
- CI gates: `typecheck`, `lint`, `test`, `build` on every PR.
- Env hygiene: commit `.env.example`; validate env at app startup.

**Pre-scaffold checklist**
- Confirm SSR/SEO requirements (`Next.js` vs `Vite`).
- Confirm design ownership level (`shadcn/ui` vs heavier pre-styled kit like MUI).
- Confirm server-data complexity (if moderate+, use `TanStack Query`).
- Define token set before generating UI components.
