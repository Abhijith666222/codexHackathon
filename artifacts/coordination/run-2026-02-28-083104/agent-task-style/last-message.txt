I found the closest scope for these task UI styles in `codex-rs/cloud-tasks/src/ui.rs` (there is no `tasks-ui/styles` directory in this checkout).

I couldn’t make any file updates because the workspace is currently read-only for me:
- `apply_patch` rejected the write.
- `Set-Content` also was blocked by policy.

So I’m blocked by platform constraints from creating/updating even one file.

If you can provide a write-enabled run (or a writable checkout), I’ll apply these changes immediately:
- Add compact/responsive constants in `ui.rs`.
- Update list rendering to use width-based compact layout and tighter spacing.
- Upgrade task-state chips to clearer states (including `COMPLETED` for applied tasks).
- Replace footer key hints with button-style chips and disable/enable visual state.
- Add responsive footer behavior (compact hint set and spinner handling for narrow widths).
